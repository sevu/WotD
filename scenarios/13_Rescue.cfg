#SCENARIO 13: RESCUE
#	You encounter an undead/Therian army. A therian appears and tells you that the reason that the other therians are fighting with the undead is that the undead hold their families hostage, and will feed the to necrophage if they try to move against the undead. Player may attempt to rescue the villagers from the undead guard, if to many civilians are lost the therian side goes renegade, if they are rescued the therians will fight on your side, and if no effort to rescue the villagers is made then the Therians will fight on the undead side.
